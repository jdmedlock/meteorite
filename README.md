## Overview

This app provides its users with the ability to explore meteorite strikes
across the globe by searching the [Meteorite Landing dataset](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh) on the Nasa
Open Data Portal.

## Usage

### UI Features

TBD

### Starting & Building the App

To start the application in development mode simply run `npm run start`from
the command line. The application will automatically open a new tab in your
browser with the url `localhost:3000`.

To start the application in production mode run `npm run serve`
from the command line. In production mode the app will automatically create a
new browser tab with the url `localhost:5000`. The main difference between
production and development modes is a Service Worker runs in productin mode to
support offline execution.

The production version of the app is build by running `npm run publish`.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables that control the operation of the app are defined in the
`.env` file in the application root. These variables and their usage are shown
in the following table. It's important to keep in mind that when these settings
in the `.env` file are changed `npm run build` must be run before they will
take effect.

Environment variables maintained in the `.env` file are made available to the
application code via `process.env.<variable-name>`. For example, the
neighborhood's latitude is accessed in the code by referencing
`process.env.REACT_APP_LAT`.

Remember that even though this keeps secure tokens like client id's and secrets
out of application code it does not make them secure.

| Environment Variable    | Description | Example Setting |
|:------------------------|:------------|:----------------|
| REACT_APP_LAT           | Latitude of the neighborhood | REACT_APP_LAT=28.4812299 |
| REACT_APP_LNG           | Longitude of the neighborhood | REACT_APP_LNG=-80.8883962 |
| REACT_APP_MAPS_URL      | Google Maps URL with API key | REACT_APP_MAPS_URL="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&key=\<YOUR-API-KEY\>" |
| REACT_APP_SEARCH_RADIUS | Radius, in meters, searches are constrained to | REACT_APP_SEARCH_RADIUS=16000 |
| REACT_APP_FS_CLIENT_ID  | Foursquare API client id | REACT_APP_FS_CLIENT_ID=ADADEAFDF4ADFADFAA5ADADFAFAD |
| REACT_APP_FS_CLIENT_SECRET | Foursquaer API client secret | REACT_APP_FS_CLIENT_SECRET=ADADEAFDF4ADFADFAA5ADADFAFAD |

information about Create React App and it's dependencies consult its
[documentation](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### External Dependencies

In addition to libraries Neighborhood Maps also depends on webservices to
provide with details about places. The [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial)
used for basic
searching and to populate information windows on the map with basic information.
